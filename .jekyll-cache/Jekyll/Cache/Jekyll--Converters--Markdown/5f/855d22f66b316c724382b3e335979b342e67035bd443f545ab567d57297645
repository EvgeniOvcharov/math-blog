I"l<p>Here we illustrate three of the famous zero-one laws for convergent sequences of random variables. Their names are: the <em>Borel-Cantelli lemma</em>, the <em>second Borel-Cantelli lemma</em>, and <em>Kolmogorovâ€™s zero-one law</em>. They are going to help us study the nuances in the relationship between almost sure convergence and complete convergence.</p>
